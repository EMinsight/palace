# Inductance Matrix for a Pair of Concentric Rings

!!! note
    
    The files for this example can be found in the
    [`examples/rings/`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings)
    directory of the *Palace* source code.

This example seeks to compute the inductance matrix for a system of two concentric
current-carrying rings of radii ``r_a`` and ``r_b``, each with width ``w``. As with the
previous example, the permeability of the surrounding medium is assumed to be the
permeability of free space. The mutual inductance, ``M_{ab}``, can be easily computed for
the case where ``r_a\ll r_b`` and ``w = 0`` using the Biot-Savart law as

```math
M_{ab} = \frac{\mu_0\pi r_b^2}{2 r_a} \,.
```

Analytic expressions for the self inductance of this configuration can also be derived, for
example from [[1]](#References) we have

```math
\begin{aligned}
M_{aa} &= \mu_0 r_a \left(\log{\frac{16 r_a}{w}}-1.75\right) \\
M_{bb} &= \mu_0 r_b \left(\log{\frac{16 r_b}{w}}-1.75\right) \,.
\end{aligned}
```

We take in this case ``r_a = 10 \text{ μm}``, ``r_b = 100 \text{ μm}``, and
``w = 1 \text{ μm}``. The `mesh.jl` script in the
[`mesh/`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings/mesh) directory is used
to generate an unstructured tetrahedral mesh with Gmsh, saved to
[`mesh/rings.msh`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings/mesh/rings.msh),
and a depiction is shown below.

The configuration file for the *Palace* simulation is
[`rings.json`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings/rings.json). The
simulation `"Type"` is `"Magnetostatic"`, and we add `"SurfaceCurrent"` boundaries for
applying a surface current to drive the inner or outer ring. The rest of the ring
boundaries are labeled as `"PEC"` boundaries, which prescribes a zero magnetic flux, or
magnetic insulation, boundary condition. The farfield is also prescribed the `"PEC"`
boundary condition. We seek a second-order solution and use the geometric multigrid AMS
solver.

The computed inductance matrix is saved to disk as `postpro/terminal-M.csv`, and below we
show its contents:

```@example include_example
include_example_file("rings", "terminal-M.csv") # hide
```

According to the analytic expressions above, for this geometry we should have

```math
M_{ab} = 1.973921\text{ pH}
```

for the mutual inductance, and

```math
\begin{aligned}
M_{aa} &= 41.78537\text{ pH}\\
M_{bb} &= 707.2050\text{ pH}
\end{aligned}
```

for the self inductances. Thus, the *Palace* solution has percent-level errors
in the self inductances versus the analytic solutions.

The typical approach used by *Palace* for lumped parameter extraction uses the computed
field energies, but one can also compute the inductance by explicitly integrating the
magnetic flux through a surface and dividing by the excitation current. This is configured
under
[`config["Boundaries"]["Postprocessing"]["Inductance"]`](../config/boundaries.md#boundaries%5B%22Postprocessing%22%5D%5B%22Inductance%22%5D)
in the configuration file. The postprocessed magnetic flux values are written to `postpro/surface-F.csv`:

```@example include_example
include_example_file("rings", "surface-F.csv") # hide
```

Combining with the values in `postpro/terminal-I.csv` we can compute the
inductance matrix in this alternative fashion,

```@example include_example
include_example_file("rings", "terminal-I.csv") # hide
```

we arrive at

```@example
using DelimitedFiles: readdlm #hide
using Printf #hide
path = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "..", "..", "test", "examples", "ref", "rings") #hide
surface_F = readdlm(joinpath(path, "surface-F.csv"), ',', Float64, skipstart=1) #hide
terminal_I = readdlm(joinpath(path, "terminal-I.csv"), ',', Float64, skipstart=1) #hide
result = copy(surface_F) #hide
result[:, 2] ./= terminal_I[:, 2] #hide
result[:, 3] ./= terminal_I[:, 2] #hide
println("        i,                M[i][1] (H),                M[i][2] (H)") #hide
for i = 1:size(result, 1) #hide
    @printf(
        " %.2e,        %+.12e,        %+.12e\n",
        result[i, 1],
        result[i, 2],
        result[i, 3]
    ) #hide
end #hide
```

The values computed using the flux integral method are in close agreement to
those above, as expected. This method of calculating the inductance matrix
directly from flux values is in general less accurate than using the energy
method, due to convergence properties of finite element functional outputs, but
serves as a validation of the energy calculation.

Lastly, we visualize the magnitude of the magnetic flux density field for the excitations of
the inner and outer rings. The files for this visualization are again saved to the
`postpro/paraview` directory.
