# Eigenmodes of a Cylinder

!!! note
    
    The files for this example can be found in the
    [`examples/cylinder/`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder)
    directory of the *Palace* source code.

## Cavity

This example demonstrates *Palace*'s eigenmode simulation type to solve for the lowest
frequency modes of a cylindrical cavity resonator. In particular, we consider a cylindrical
cavity filled with Teflon (``\varepsilon_r = 2.08``,
``\tan\delta = 4\times 10^{-4}``), with radius ``a = 2.74\text{ cm}`` and height
``d = 2a``. From [[1]](#References), the frequencies of the ``\text{TE}_{nml}`` and
``\text{TM}_{nml}`` modes are given by

```math
\begin{aligned}
f_{\text{TE},nml} &= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}}
    \sqrt{\left(\frac{p'_{nm}}{a}\right)^2 +
    \left(\frac{l\pi}{d}\right)^2} \\
f_{\text{TM},nml} &= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}}
    \sqrt{\left(\frac{p_{nm}}{a}\right)^2 +
    \left(\frac{l\pi}{d}\right)^2} \\
\end{aligned}
```

where  ``p_{nm}`` and ``p'_{nm}`` denote the ``m``-th root (``m\geq 1``) of the ``n``-th
order Bessel function (``n\geq 0``) of the first kind, ``J_n``, and its derivative,
``J'_n``, respectively.

In addition, we have analytic expressions for the unloaded quality factors due to dielectric
loss, ``Q_d``, and imperfectly conducting walls, ``Q_c``. In particular,

```math
Q_d = \frac{1}{\tan\delta}
```

and, for a surface resistance ``R_s``,

```math
Q_c = \frac{(ka)^3\eta ad}{4(p'_{nm})^2 R_s}
    \left[1-\left(\frac{n}{p'_{nm}}\right)^2\right]
    \left\{\frac{ad}{2}
        \left[1+\left(\frac{\beta an}{(p'_{nm})^2}\right)^2\right] +
        \left(\frac{\beta a^2}{p'_{nm}}\right)^2
        \left(1-\frac{n^2}{(p'_{nm})^2}\right)\right\}^{-1}
```

where ``k=\omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}``, ``\eta=\sqrt{\mu/\varepsilon}``, and
``\beta=l\pi/d``.

The initial Gmsh mesh for this problem, from
[`mesh/cavity_prism.msh`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/mesh/cavity_prism.msh),
is shown below. We use quadratic triangular prism elements. There are also two other
included mesh files,
[`mesh/cavity_tet.msh`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/mesh/cavity_tet.msh)
and
[`mesh/cavity_hex.msh`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/mesh/cavity_hex.msh),
which use curved tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, respectively.

There are two configuration files for this problem,
[`cavity_pec.json`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/cavity_pec.json)
and
[`cavity_impedance.json`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/cavity_impedance.json).

In both, the [`config["Problem"]["Type"]`](../config/problem.md#config%5B%22Problem%22%5D)
field is set to `"Eigenmode"`, and we use the mesh shown above. The material properties for
Teflon are entered under
[`config["Domains"]["Materials"]`](../config/domains.md#domains%5B%22Materials%22%5D). The
[`config["Domains"]["Postprocessing"]["Energy]"`](../config/domains.md#domains%5B%22Postprocessing%22%5D%5B%22Energy%22%5D)
object is used to extract the quality factor due to bulk dielectric loss; in this problem
since there is only one domain this is trivial, but in problems with multiple material
domains this feature can be used to isolate the energy-participation ratio (EPR) and
associated quality factor due to different domains in the model.

The only difference between the two configuration files is in the `"Boundaries"` object:
`cavity_pec.json` prescribes a perfect electric conductor (`"PEC"`) boundary condition to
the cavity boundary surfaces, while `cavity_impedance.json` prescribes a surface impedance
condition with the surface resistance ``R_s = 0.0184\text{ }\Omega\text{/sq}``, for copper
at ``5\text{ GHz}``.

In both cases, we configure the eigenvalue solver to solve for the ``15`` lowest frequency
modes above ``2.0\text{ GHz}`` (the dominant mode frequencies for both the
``\text{TE}`` and ``\text{TM}`` cases fall around ``2.9\text{ GHz}`` frequency for this
problem). A sparse direct solver is used for the solutions of the linear system resulting
from the spatial discretization of the governing equations, using in this case a
fourth-order finite element space.

The frequencies for the lowest-order ``\text{TE}`` and ``\text{TM}`` modes computed using
the above formula for this problem are listed in the table below.

| ``(n,m,l)`` | ``f_{\text{TE}}``       | ``f_{\text{TM}}``       |
|:----------- | -----------------------:| -----------------------:|
| ``(0,1,0)`` | ----                    | ``2.903605\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(1,1,0)`` | ----                    | ``4.626474\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(2,1,0)`` | ----                    | ``6.200829\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(0,1,1)`` | ``5.000140\text{ GHz}`` | ``3.468149\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(1,1,1)`` | ``2.922212\text{ GHz}`` | ``5.000140\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(2,1,1)`` | ``4.146842\text{ GHz}`` | ``6.484398\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(0,1,2)`` | ``5.982709\text{ GHz}`` | ``4.776973\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(1,1,2)`` | ``4.396673\text{ GHz}`` | ``5.982709\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(2,1,2)`` | ``5.290341\text{ GHz}`` | ``7.269033\text{ GHz}`` |

First, we examine the output of the `cavity_pec.json` simulation. The file
`postpro/cavity_pec/eig.csv` contains information about the computed eigenfrequencies and
associated quality factors:

```@example include_example
include_example_file("cylinder/cavity_pec", "eig.csv") # hide
```

Indeed we can find a correspondence between the analytic modes predicted and the solutions
obtained by *Palace*. Since the only source of loss in the simulation is the nonzero
dielectric loss tangent, we have ``Q = Q_d = 1/0.0004 = 2.50\times 10^3`` in all cases.

Next, we run `cavity_impedance.json`, which  adds the surface impedance boundary condition.
Examining `postpro/cavity_impedance/eig.csv` we see that the mode frequencies are roughly
unchanged but the quality factors have fallen due to the addition of imperfectly conducting
walls to the model:

```@example include_example
include_example_file("cylinder/cavity_impedance", "eig.csv") # hide
```

However, the bulk dielectric loss postprocessing results, computed from the energies written
to `postpro/cavity_impedance/domain-E.csv`, still give ``Q_d = 1/0.004 = 2.50\times 10^3`` for
every mode as expected.

Focusing on the ``\text{TE}_{011}`` mode with ``f_{\text{TE},010} = 5.00\text{ GHz}``, we
can read the mode quality factor ``Q = 2.30\times 10^3``. Subtracting out the contribution
of dielectric losses, we have

```math
Q_c = \left(\frac{1}{Q}-\frac{1}{Q_d}\right)^{-1} = 2.94\times 10^4
```

which is the same as the analytical result given in Example 6.4 from [[1]](#References) for
this geometry.

Finally, a clipped view of the electric field (left) and magnetic flux density magnitudes
for the ``\text{TE}_{011}`` mode is shown below.

### Mesh convergence

The effect of mesh size can be investigated for the cylindrical cavity resonator using
[`convergence_study.jl`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/convergence_study.jl).
For a polynomial order of solution and refinement level, a mesh is generated using Gmsh
using polynomials of the same order to resolve the boundary geometry. The eigenvalue
problem is then solved for ``f_{\text{TM},010}`` and ``f_{\text{TE},111}``, and the
relative error, ``\frac{f-f_{\text{true}}}{f_{\text{true}}}``, of each mode plotted against
``\text{DOF}^{-\frac{1}{3}}``, a notional mesh size. Three different element types are
considered: tetrahedra, prisms and hexahedra, and the results are plotted below. The
``x``-axis is a notional measure of the overall cost of the solve, accounting for
polynomial order.

```@raw html
<br/><p align="center">
  <img src="../../assets/examples/cavity-3a.png" width="70%" />
  <img src="../../assets/examples/cavity-3b.png" width="70%" />
  <img src="../../assets/examples/cavity-3c.png" width="70%" />
</p><br/>
```

The observed rate of convergence for the eigenvalues are ``p+1`` for odd polynomials and
``p+2`` for even polynomials. Given the eigenmodes are analytic functions, the theoretical
maximum convergence rate is ``2p`` [[2]](#References). The figures demonstrate that
increasing the polynomial order of the solution will give reduced error, however the effect
may only become significant on sufficiently refined meshes.

## Waveguide

This example demonstrates the eigenmode simulation type in  *Palace* to solve for the
cutoff-frequencies of a circular waveguide. As with the cavity the interior material to be
Silicon (``\varepsilon_r = 2.08``, ``\tan\delta = 4\times 10^{-4}``), with cylindrical
domain radius ``a = 2.74\text{ cm}``, and length ``d=2a = 5.48\text{ cm}``, however now
periodic boundary conditions are applied in the $z$-direction. According to
[[1]](#References), the cutoff frequencies for the transverse electric and magnetic modes
are given by the formulae:

```math
\begin{aligned}
f_{\text{TE},nm} &= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}} \frac{p'_{nm}}{a}\\
f_{\text{TM},nm} &= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}} \frac{p_{nm}}{a}
\end{aligned}
```

which are identical to those for the cavity modes, in the special case of ``l=0``.

In addition to these pure waveguide modes, there are aliasing cavity
modes corresponding to a full wavelength in the computational domain (``l=2``). In a
practical problem these can be suppressed by choosing a smaller value of ``d`` which shifts
such modes to higher frequencies. The relevant modes are tabulated as

| ``(n,m,l)`` | ``f_{\text{TE}}``       | ``f_{\text{TM}}``       |
|:----------- | -----------------------:| -----------------------:|
| ``(0,1,0)`` | ``4.626481\text{ GHz}`` | ``2.903636\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(1,1,0)`` | ``2.223083\text{ GHz}`` | ``4.626481\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(2,1,0)`` | ``3.687749\text{ GHz}`` | ``6.200856\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(3,1,0)`` | ``5.072602\text{ GHz}`` | ``7.703539\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(0,1,2)`` | ``5.982715\text{ GHz}`` | ``4.776992\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(1,1,2)`` | ``4.396663\text{ GHz}`` | ``5.982715\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(2,1,2)`` | ``5.290372\text{ GHz}`` | ``7.269056\text{ GHz}`` |
| ``(3,1,2)`` | ``6.334023\text{ GHz}`` | ``8.586796\text{ GHz}`` |

For this problem, we use curved tetrahedral elements from the mesh file
[`mesh/cavity_tet.msh`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/mesh/cavity_tet.msh),
and the configuration files
[`waveguide.json`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/waveguide.json) and
[`floquet.json`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/cylinder/floquet.json).

The main difference between these configuration files and those used in the cavity example is
in the `"Boundaries"` object: `waveguide.json` specifies a perfect electric conductor
(`"PEC"`) boundary condition for the exterior surface and a periodic boundary condition
(`"Periodic"`) on the cross-sections of the cylinder (in the $z-$ direction). The periodic
attribute pairs are defined by `"DonorAttributes"` and `"ReceiverAttributes"`, and the
distance between them is given by the `"Translation"` vector in mesh units. In `floquet.json`,
an additional `"FloquetWaveVector"` specifies the phase delay between the donor and receiver
boundaries in the X/Y/Z directions.

The file `postpro/waveguide/eig.csv` contains information about the computed eigenfrequencies and
associated quality factors:

```@example include_example
include_example_file("cylinder/waveguide", "eig.csv") # hide
```

In common with the PEC cavity ``Q = Q_d = 1/0.0004 = 2.50\times 10^3`` in all cases, and all
the anticipated waveguide modes are recovered with ``\text{TE}_{1,1}`` having the lowest
cutoff frequency followed by ``\text{TM}_{0,1}`` and ``\text{TE}_{2,1}``, while the aliasing
mode ``\text{TE}_{1,1,2}`` has marginally lower frequency than the waveguide modes
``\text{TE}_{0,1}`` and ``\text{TM}_{1,1}`` (``4.397\text{ GHz}`` compared to ``4.627\text{ GHz}``) and is thus found first.
